## How to Use

Each folder corresponds to a topic. Inside, you'll find individual `.py` files named by LeetCode problem number and title (e.g. `1-TwoSum.py`, `217-containsDuplicate.py`).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShashikarNEU/Neetcode---150.git
cd Neetcode---150

# Navigate to a topic
cd 1-Arrays_and_Hashing

# Run a solution
python 1-TwoSum.py
```
