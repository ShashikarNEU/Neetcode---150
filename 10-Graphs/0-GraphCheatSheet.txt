GRAPH PATTERNS

Start with basic representation methods - adj_list, matrix 
Refer intro graphs for that

Then move on the basic BFS, DFS then, matrix version of BFS and DFS

Then Go through the neetcode 150 list
Try island perimeter -> no of islands -> max area of island -> large island (IN this order!!)
Starting from walls and gates, rotting oranges -> learn Multi Source BFS

Then do toplogical sort - DFS & Kahn's algo
Do Coursch 1,2,4

kahn algo pattern + reverse the edges (Think from the destination) - course sch1 & 2 then do lc 802, 1059

FOR DSU, it's undirected graphs so, check if the graph is undirected
Then Learn DSU(Disjoint set union)
last 3 questions are direct DSU

So, now jump into DSU PATTERNS
Try power grid maintaince lc 3067 then do account merge
This pattern - after DSU, take a hashMap[root] -> nodes
Find root by using DSU.find(root)
no of entries in hashMap represents no of connected componenets

Always, shortest path without weights -> Go for BFS

Also, TRY some questions like BiPartition(lc 886)[Good Question], Open the lock(lc 752)
